I am having overall 3 years of full stack development experience in Java Spring Boot I am having
2.5 years of experience. Majorly I worked as a Backend Developer. And my other technology stack 
includes MYSQL, MSSQL, React, Android.

Currently, I am working with Allscripts. Company is having its product in HealthCare Domain.
And I am working on Paragon Project, it is EHR platform used by community hospitals across the USA.
This app is supported by web and mobile devices.

If we talk about my roles and responsibilities in my current that are 
Gathering the requirement from solution management and grooming the discussion withing the team
discussion about th feature work or bug fix development. In feature work most of the time 
I worked on developing REST APIs and SQL Stored Procedures. And coming to
frontend part I didn't get much chance to work on feature work. But done some 
bug fix development. We do have CICD pipeline and working in AGILE.
