Thrads are light weight processes within the process, and memory allocated to that process will be shared among all threads
Hence it is important to manage the shared resources while we are working in multithreaded environment. But Per Thread/ Per Stack memory

----------Two ways two create threads in JAVA-----------

1) extends Thread & @Override run()
2) implements Runnable & @Override run() (Best way)

* When you extend Thread class, you canâ€™t extend any other class which you require.
(As you know, Java does not allow inheriting more than one class).
When you implement Runnable, you can save a space for your class to extend any other class in future or now.

However, the significant difference is.

* When you extends Thread class, each of your thread creates unique object and associate with it.
When you implements Runnable, it shares the same object to multiple threads.

* Order of execution is not predictable i.e may give different result at each program run
